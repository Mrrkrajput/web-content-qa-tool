Hey there! Here's how to get my Web Content Q&A Tool up and running on your computer, plus how to play around with it.

How to Run It Locally
---------------------

1. **Grab the Code**
   - If it’s on GitHub, just type this in your terminal:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-content-qa-tool.git
     cd web-content-qa-tool
     ```
     (Swap "your-username" with whoever’s GitHub it’s on.)
   - Or snag `app.py` and `index.html` yourself and toss them in a folder like `web-content-qa-tool`. Then hop into that folder:
     ```
     cd wherever-you-put-it/web-content-qa-tool
     ```

2. **Set It Up**
   - Fire up your terminal and run this to get all the stuff it needs:
     ```
     pip install flask requests beautifulsoup4 trafilatura transformers torch
     ```

3. **Kick It Off**
   - Type this to start it:
     ```
     python app.py
     ```
   - It’ll pop up at `http://localhost:5000`.

4. **Open It Up**
   - Head to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser, and you’re in!

How to Use It
-------------

1. **Feed It Some Websites**
   - In the "Enter URLs" box, drop in some web addresses, one per line, like:
     ```
     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)
     ```
   - Hit "Ingest Content" to load them up.

2. **Ask Away**
   - In the "Ask a question" spot, type something like:
     ```
     What’s Python all about?
     ```
   - Click "Ask Question," and the answer shows up below—like maybe "it’s a cool programming language for all sorts of stuff."

3. **Keep Going**
   - Toss in more URLs or ask more questions whenever you feel like it!

That’s it—have fun messing around with it!
